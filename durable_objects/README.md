Reminder: Durable Objects currently do not get published with git push (only one DO, no branching functionality). 
Manually use `npm run deploy` or `wrangler deploy` in this directory to publish.


## TODO

As of now, the Hibernatable WebSocket API does not have TypeScript type definitions, and I would rather just write a P2P system than write my own types and have to deal with the jankiness there with durable objects. 

I would ideally like to revisit this once the Hibernatable WebSocket API is more stable.
